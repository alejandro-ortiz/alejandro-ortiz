        <p>Hi, I’m Alejandro Ortiz. I enjoy in Rocketry, Tennis, Web Development, Electronics, and Scouts. I am
            currently learning Git and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>❤️My dream job is to teach or play tennis as tennis has really shown me if you put your mind to something almost anything can be accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>❤️My dream is to teach others about tennis so they can enjoy it just as much as I do.
        </p>
        <p>My favorite coding tools include VS Code, Git, GitHub, and MacOS.
        </p>
        <p>Tennis has been amazing and has helped me to discover more about myself</p>
        <p>I like playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Minecraft
        </p>
